\begin_layout Title
MultiGWAS: An integrative tool for Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
 in tetraploid organisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\series bold
Summary:
\series default
 The Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are essential to determine the
 association between genetic variants across individuals.
 One way to support the results is by using different tools to validate
 the reproducibility of the associations.
 Currently, software for GWAS in diploids is well-established but for polyploids
 species is scarce.
 Each GWAS software has its characteristics, which can cost time and effort
 to use them successfully.
 Here, we present MultiGWAS, a tool to do GWAS analysis in tetraploid organisms
 by executing in parallel and integrating the results from four existing
 GWAS software: two available for polyploids (GWASpoly and SHEsis) and two
 frequently used for diploids (PLINK and TASSEL).
 The tool deals with all the elements of the GWAS process in the four software,
 including 
\color blue
(1) the input and conversion between genotypic data file formats
\color inherit
 (2) the use of different control quality filters for the genomic data,
 (3) the execution of two GWAS models, the full model with control for populatio
n structure and individual relatedness and the Naive model without any control.
 
\color blue
(4) The integration and reporting of results.

\color inherit
 The summary report generated by MultiGWAS provides the user with tables
 and plots describing intuitively the significant association found by both
 each one and across four software, which helps users to check for false-positiv
e or false-negative results.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

MultiGWAS generates five summary results integrating the four tools.
 (1) Score tables with detailed information on the associations for each
 tool.
 (2) Venn diagrams of shared SNPs among the four tools.
 (3) Heatmaps of significative SNP profiles among the four tools.
 (4) Manhattan and QQ plots for the association found by each tool.
 And (5) Chord diagrams for the chromosomes vs.
 SNP by each tool.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) comprise statistical tests that
 identify which variants through the whole genome of a large number of individua
ls are associated with a specific trait (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cantor2010prioritizing,begum2012comprehensive"

\end_inset

).
 This methodology started with humans and several model plants, such as
 rice, maize, and 
\emph on
Arabidopsis
\emph default
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lauc2010genomics,tian2011genome,cao2011whole,korte2013advantages,han2013sequencing"

\end_inset

).
 Because of the advances in the next-gen sequencing technology and the decline
 of the sequencing cost in recent years, there is an increase in the availabilit
y of genome sequences of different organisms at a faster rate (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ekblom2011applications,ellegren2014genome"

\end_inset

).
 Thus, the GWAS is becoming the standard tool to understand the genetic
 bases of either ecologically or economically relevant phenotypic variation
 for both model and non-model organisms.
 This increment includes complex species such as polyploids (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GWAS for polyploid species has fourth related challenges.
 First, replication is critical to validate GWAS results and capture real
 associations.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
lc{LUIS: Aquí este "This" debería ser "Our", ya que "This" lo entiendo como
 que se refiere al enfoque general de replication en GWAS, que es algo distinto
 ya que se hace sobre distintos conjuntos de muestras, y usando los mismo
 parámetros o modelos}
\end_layout

\end_inset

This approach involved using different parameters, models, or conditions
 to test how consistent the results are in the same software or different
 GWAS tools (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "De2014, Pearson2008"

\end_inset

).
 However, the performance of different GWAS software could affect the results.
 For example, the significance threshold for 
\begin_inset Formula $pvalue$
\end_inset

 changes through four GWAS software (i.e., PLINK, TASSEL, GAPIT, and FaST-LMM)
 when the sample size varies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yan2019"

\end_inset

).
 It means that well-ranked SNPs from one package can be ranked differently
 in another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, there are very few tools focused on the integration of several GWAS
 software, to make comparisons under different parameters and conditions
 across them.
 As far as we are aware, there is only two software with this service in
 mind, which are iPAT and easyGWAS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The iPAT allows running in a graphic interface three well-known command-line
 GWAS software such as GAPIT, PLINK, and FarmCPU (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zhang2018"

\end_inset

).
 However, the output from each package is separated.
 On the other hand, the easyGWAS allows running a GWAS analysis on the web
 using different algorithms and combining several GWAS results.
 This analysis runs independently of both the computer capacity and the
 operating system.
 Nevertheless, it needs either several datasets to obtain the different
 GWAS results to make replicates or GWAS results already computed.
 In either case, the results from different algorithms are also separated
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Grimm2017"

\end_inset

).
 Thus, although both software iPAT and easyGWAS integrate with different
 programs or algorithms, an output that allows them to compare similitudes
 and differences in the association is missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, although there are different GWAS software available to repeat the
 analysis under different conditions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gumpinger2018"

\end_inset

), most of them are designed exclusively for the diploid data matrix (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bourke2018"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, it is often necessary to "diploidizing" the polyploid genomic
 data in order to replicate the analysis.
 The main consequence of this process is missing the complexity of polyploid
 data to understand how allele dosage affects the phenotype expression (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ferrao2018"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, for polyploid species, any tool that integrates and compares different
 gene action among software is key to understanding how redundancy or complex
 interaction among alleles affects the phenotype expression and the evolution
 of new phenotypes (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bourke2018, Rosyara2016, Ferrao2018"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To overcome these challenges, we developed the MultiGWAS tool that performs
 GWAS analyses for both diploid and tetraploid species using four software
 in parallel.
 Our tool includes GWASpoly (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rosyara2016"

\end_inset

) and the SHEsis tool (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Shen2016"

\end_inset

) that accept polyploid genomic data, and PLINK (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Purcell2007"

\end_inset

) and TASSEL (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bradbury2007"

\end_inset

), originally designed exclusively for diploids, but that in the case of
 tetraploid data, their use require "diploidizing" genomic matrix.
 This wrapping tool deals with different input file formats, including VCF.
 Besides, manage data preprocessing, search for associations by running
 four GWAS software in parallel, and create a score to choose between gene
 action models in GWASPoly and TASSEL.
 Moreover, create comparative reports from the output of each software to
 help the user distinguish genuine associations from false positives.

The MultiGWAS tool has three main consecutive steps: the adjustment, the
 multi analysis, and the integration (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 In the adjustment step, MultiGWAS processes the configuration file.
 Then it cleans and filters the genotype and phenotype, and MultiGWAS "diploidiz
e" the genomic data.
 Next, during the multi analysis, each GWAS tool runs in parallel.
 Subsequently, in the integration step, the MultiGWAS tool scans the output
 files from the four packages (i.e., GWASPoly, SHEsis, PLink, and TASSEL).
 Finally, it generates a summary of all results that contains score tables,
 Venn diagrams, SNP profiles, and Manhattan plots.

MultiGWAS takes as input a configuration file where the user specifies the
 genomics data along with the parameters that will be used by the four tools.
 Once the configuration file is read and processed, the genomic data files
 (genotype and phenotype) are preprocessed by cleaning, filtering, and checking
 data quality.
 The output of this stage corresponds to the inputs for the four programs

GWAS model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is designed to work with quantitative phenotypes and can run GWAS
 analysis using two types of statistical models that we have called 
\emph on
full
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
naive
\emph default
 models.
 The 
\emph on
full model
\emph default
 is know in the literature as the Q+K model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yu2006"

\end_inset

 and includes control for structure (Q) and relatedness between samples
 (K), whereas the 
\emph on
naive model
\emph default
 does not include any type of correction.
 Both models are based on linear regression approaches and variations of
 them are implemented by the four GWAS packages used by MultiGWAS.
 The 
\emph on
naive
\emph default
 is modeled with Generalized Linear Models (GLMs, Phenotype + Genotype),
 and the 
\emph on
full
\emph default
 is modeled with Mixed Linear Models (MLMs, Phenotype + Genotype + Structure
 + Kinship).
 The default model used by MultiGWAS is the 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
GWAS searches SNPs associated with the phenotype in a statistically significant
 manner.
 A threshold or significance level 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 is specified and compared with the 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 derived for each association score.
 Standard significance levels are 0.01 or 0.05 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gumpinger2018,Rosyara2016"

\end_inset

, and MultiGWAS uses an 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 of 0.05 for the four GWAS packages.
 But the threshold is adjusted according to each package, as some packages
 as GWASpoly and TASSEL calculates the SNP effect for each genotypic class
 using different gene action models (see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Multi analysis stage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 So, the number of tested markers
\emph on
 
\emph default
may be different in each model (see below) that results in different 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 thresholds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Multiple testing correction:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the massive number of statistical tests performed by GWAS, it is
 necessary to perform a correction method for multiple hypothesis testing
 and adjusting the 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 threshold accordingly.
 Two common methods for multiple hypothesis testing are the false discovery
 rate (FDR) and the Bonferroni correction.
 The latter is the default method used by MultiGWAS, which is one of the
 most stringent methods.
 However, instead of adjusting the 
\emph on
p-values,
\emph default
 MultiGWAS adjust the threshold below which a 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 is considered significant, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha/m$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the significance level and 
\emph on
m 
\emph default
is the number of tested markers from the genotype matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Number of reported associations: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Criticism has arisen in considering only statistically significant associations
 as the only possible correct associations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Thomson2011,Kaler2019"

\end_inset

.
 Many of low 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 associations, closer to being significant, are discarded due to the stringent
 significance levels, and consequently increasing the number of false negatives.
 To help to analyze both significant and non-significant associations, MultiGWAS
 provides the option to specify the number of best-ranked associations (lower
 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
), adding the corresponding 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 to each association found.
 In this way, it is possible to enlarge the number of results, and we can
 observe replicability in the results for different programs.
 Nevertheless, we present each association with the corresponding 
\emph on

\emph default
.

Quality control filters:

\begin_layout Standard
A control step is necessary to check the input data for genotype or phenotype
 errors or poor quality that can lead to spurious GWAS results.
 MultiGWAS provides the option to select and define thresholds for the following
 filters that control the data quality: Minor Allele Frequency (MAF), individual

At this point, the format "ACGT" suitable for the polyploid software GWASpoly

 The homozygous tetraploid genotypes are converted to diploid thus: AAAA→AA,
 CCCC→CC, GGGG→GG, TTTT→TT.
 Moreover, for tetraploid heterozygous genotypes, the conversion depends
 on the reference and alternate alleles calculated for each position (e.g.,
 AAAT →AT, ...

MultiGWAS runs in parallel using two types of statistical models specified
 in the parameters file, the Full model (Q+K) and Naive (i.e., without any

 calculated by kinship coeficients across individuals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The Full model (Q+K) controls for both population structure and individual
 relatedness.
 For population structure, MultiGWAS uses the Principal Component Analysis
 (PCA) and takes the top five PC as covariates.
 For relatedness, MultiGWAS uses kinship matrices that TASSEL and GWASpoly
 calculated separately, and for PLINK and SHEsis, relatedness depends on
 kinship coefficients calculated with the PLINK 2.0 built-in algorithm

 GWASpoly uses a Q+K linear mixed model with biallelic SNPs that account
 for population structure and relatedness.
 Also, to calculate the SNP effect for each genotypic class, GWASpoly provides
 eight gene action models: general, additive, simplex dominant alternative,
 simplex dominant reference, duplex dominant alternative,duplex dominant,
 diplo-general, and diplo-additive.
 As a consequence, the number of statistical test performed can be different
 in each action model and so thresholds below which the 
\emph on

 are considered significant.

 For the association analysis, TASSEL includes the general linear model

 Moreover, as GWASPoly, TASSEL provides three-gene action models to calculate
 the SNP effect of each genotypic class: general, additive, and dominant,
 and so the significance threshold depends on each action model.

\begin_layout Standard
However, the significance threshold can be different for each GWAS package

 For both PLINK and SHEsis packages, which use only one model, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is equal to the total number of SNPs.
 However, for both GWASpoly and TASSEL packages, which use eight and three

Furthermore, most GWAS packages compute both

 This results in the loss of real associations, the so-called false negatives.
 To overcome these difficulties, MultiGWAS reports two sets of associations:
 significant and best-rankes (those closest to being statistically significant),
 as described below.

\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of PLINK and SHEsis which have a unique gene action model, the
 associations are taken as described above.
 But, in the case of GWASpoly and TASSEL, which have several (the first

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

), MultiGWAS automatically selects the "best gene action model" from the
 package and takes the associations from it.
 The model selection is based on three criteria: the inflation factor (I),
 the shared SNPs (R) and the significant SNPs (S).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each gene action model is scored using the following equation: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Formula $score(M_{i})=I{}_{i}+R_{i}+S{}_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $score(M_{i})$
\end_inset

 is the score for the gene action model

\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $1..k$

\begin_inset Formula $k$

 gene action models.
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$

 is the score for the inflation factor defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}=1-|1-\lambda(M_{i})|$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(M_{i})$
\end_inset

 is the inflation factor for the 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 model.
 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the score of the shared SNPs defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}=\sum\limits _{j=1}^{k}{\textstyle |M_{i}\sim M_{j}|}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula ${\textstyle |M_{i}\sim M_{j}|}$
\end_inset

 is the number of SNPs shared between 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{j}$
\end_inset

 models, normalized by the maximum number of SNPs shared between all models.
 And, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the number of significant SNPs of model 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 normalized by the total number SNPs shared among all models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align block
The score is high when an 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 model has an inflation factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 close to 1, identifies a high number of shared SNPs, and contains one or
 more significant SNPs.
 Conversely, the score is low when the 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 model has an inflation factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 either low (close to 0) or high (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda>2$
\end_inset

 SNPs.
 In any other case, the score is balanced between the inflation factor,
 the number of shared SNPs, and the number of significant SNPs.

 Samples with close genotypes form together clusters.
 Thus to generate the clusters, we do not use the phenotype information.

All four GWAS packages adopted by MultiGWAS use linear regression approaches.
 However, they often produce different association results for the same
 input.
 Computed 
\emph on
p-values 
\emph default
for the same set of SNPs are different between packages.
 Therefore, SNPs with significant 
\emph on
p-values

 for one package maybe not significant for the others.
 Alternatively, well-ranked SNPs in one package may be ranked differently
 in another.

 MultiGWAS produces five types of results combining graphics and tables

 In both plots, the points are the SNPs and their p-values are transformed
 into scores like

\end_inset

 (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The Manhattan plot shows the strength of association of the SNPs (y-axis)
 distributed at their genomic location (x-axis), so the higher the score,
 the stronger the association.
 While the QQ plot compares the expected distribution of 
\emph on
p-values

 In the case of the tetraploid potato, several SNPs are observed to be shared
 between the four packages (green dots).
 The best-ranked SNPs are above the blue line, but only GWASpoly and SHEsis
 identified significant associations (SNPs above the red line).
 However, the inflation factor given by SHEsis is too high (

Tables and Venn diagrams for single and shared SNPs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS provides tabular and graphic views to report the best-ranked and
 significant SNPs identified by the four GWAS packages in an integrative
 way (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Table-Shared-SNPs"

\end_inset

).
 Both 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 and significance levels have been scaled as 
\begin_inset Formula $-log_{10}(\mathB{p-value})$
\end_inset

 to give high scores to the best statistically evaluated SNPs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, best-ranked SNPs correspond to the top-scored 
\emph on
N
\emph default
 SNPs, whether they were assessed significant or not by its package, and
 with
\emph on

 defined by the user in the configuration file.
 These SNPs appears in both a SNPs table (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.a), and in a Venn diagram (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Table-Shared-SNPs"

.b).
 The table lists them by package and sorts by decreasing score, whereas
 the Venn diagram emphasizes if they were best-ranked either in a single
 package or in several at once (shared).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, the significant SNPs correspond to the ones valued statistically
 significant by each package.
 They appear in a Venn diagram (Figure

In this analysis, the polyploid packages GWASpoly and SHEsis co-idientified
 the SNPs c2_25471, c2_45611, and c1_8019.
 Of these SNPs, c1_8019, has been reported in previous studies to be associated
 with tuber shape and depth of eye traits (

 Furthermore, in another analysis of MultiGWAS using a naive model without

 three packages: GWASpoly, SHEsis, and the diploid PLINK package .

Heat diagrams for the structure of shared SNPs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS creates a two-dimensional representation, called the SNP profile,
 to visualize each trait by individuals and genotypes as rows and columns,
 respectively (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SNP-profiles"

\end_inset

).
 At the left, the individuals are grouped in a dendrogram by their genotype.
 At the right, there is the name or ID of each individual.
 At the bottom, the genotypes are ordered from left to right, starting from
 the major to the minor allele (i.e., AAAA, AAAB, AABB, ABBB, BBBB).
 At the top, there is a description of the trait based on a histogram of
 frequency (top left) and by an assigned color for each numerical phenotype
 value using a grayscale (top right).
 Thus, each individual appears as a colored line by its phenotype value
 on its genotype column.
 For each column, there is a solid cyan line with the mean of each column
 and a broken cyan line that indicates how far the cell deviates from the
 mean.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because each multiGWAS report shows one specific trait at a time, the histogram
 and color key will remain the same for all the best-ranked SNPs.

 PÃ¡rrafo 1.
 Generally, in a typical GWAS analysis the strongest associations are signaled
 by several nearby-correlated SNPs located in the same chromosome, as in
 manhattan plots, where these associations form neat peaks with several
 SNPs showing the same signal.
 Conversely, no peaks are shown when few SNPs correlate with a trait.

 The more associations identified in one chromosome, the wider the space
 of its sector.

MutiGWAS uses as the only input a simple configuration text file with the
 values for the main parameters that drive the analysis.
 To create the configuration text file, users can choose either a text editor
 or the MultiGWAS GUI application.
 If users prefer a text file, it must have the parameter names and values
 separated by a colon, filenames enclosed in quotation marks, and TRUE or
 FALSE values to indicate if filters are applied.
 If the users prefer the GUI applications, they can create the configuration
 file using the input parameter view.
 In any case, this file must have the structure shown in the Figure(Figure

\begin_layout Standard
The reanalysis of potato data with MultiGWAS showed that this tool is handy
 to improve the GWAS in tetraploid species.
 Through MultiGWAS performance, we could test its effectiveness to answer
 some of the challenges associating phenotypic in a polyploid organism.
 They include the integration and replication among parameters and software,
 the diploidization of polyploid data, and the incorporation of allele dosage
 models (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dufresne2014"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main advantage of MultiGWAS is that replicate the GWAS analysis among
 four software and integrate the results obtained across software, models
 and parameters.
 Depending on the software, users usually have to choose between sensitivity
 or specificity.
 But using MultiGWAS, users do not have to choose between both approaches
 because they can observe their effect in the analysis within the same environme
nt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difficulty for replication among software is the variability of
 structures for the genomic input data.
 Currently, the most common format for next-generation sequencing variant
 data is the VCF (Variant Call Format) (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Danecek2011"

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ebbert2014"

\end_inset

) .
 One of the advantages of VCF is the versatility to summarize important
 genome information for hundreds or thousands of individuals and SNP, including
 information about levels of ploidy.
 MultiGWAS different from most of GWAS software available allows the VCF
 as an input (but see VarStats tool in VTC).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, the MultiGWAS is the unique tool as far as we know that allows
 us to compare the effect of diploidized the tetraploid data in the performance
 of the analysis directly.
 The graphic outputs are a handy approach to find similar results.
 The SNP profile allows identifying what the significant associations detected
 by more than one software are.
 Furthermore, although MultiGWAS check for significative SNPs based on the
 p-value, it is essential to go back to the data and check if the SNP is
 a real association between the genotype and phenotype.
 For this purpose, the SNP profile gives visual feedback for the accuracy
 of the association.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the MultyGWAS allows comparing among the gene action models that
 offer GWASPoly and TASSEL.
 GWASpoly (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rosyara2016"

\end_inset

) provides models of different types of polyploid gene action including
 additive, diploidized additive, duplex dominant, simplex dominant, and
 general.
 On the other hand, TASSEL (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bradbury2007"

\end_inset

) also models different types of gene action for diploids general, additive
 and dominant.
 To choose among models, We propose an automatic selection of the gene action
 model for both tools based on a balance between three criteria: the inflation
 factor, the replicability of identified SNPs and the significance of identified
 SNPs.
 This inflation index is a new tool for comparison that do not offer either
 GWASPoly or TASSEL.
 This automatic strategy will help to understand the gene action model for
 the trait of interest.
 Even though the main focus is on the resultant SNPs, the model has assumptions
 that reflect the gene actions for a specific phenotype.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, although MultyGWAS does not solve the uncertainty in
 the allele dosage and null alleles, However the active comparison among
 models that MultiGWAS addresses the search of the inheritance mechanisms
 by comparing among two designed for polysomic inheritance software (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rosyara2016, Shen2016"

\end_inset

) with two software for disomic inheritance (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Purcell2007, Bradbury2007"

\end_inset

).
 Understanding the inheritance mechanisms for polyploids organism is an
 open question.
 For autopolyploids, most loci have a polysomic heritage.
 However, sections of the genome that did not duplicate lead to disomic
 inheritance for some loci (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ohno1970, lynch2000,dufresne2014"

\end_inset

).
 Thus it is a useful tool for researchers because it looks for significative
 associations that involve both types of inheritance.

Challenges studying polyploid organisms are related to the complexity of
 (1) the data, and (2) inheritance mechanisms that are under study (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dufresne2014"

\end_inset

).
 The difficulties regarding the data complexity are the uncertainty in the
 allele dosage and null alleles, but these problems are opportunities to
 improve software at the variant calling stage.
 Moreover, there is an on-going understanding of the inheritance mechanisms
 for polyploids.
 For autopolyploids, most loci have a polysomic inheritance.
 However, sections of the genome that did not duplicate lead to disomic
 inheritance for some loci (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS does not face the problem of the allele dosage uncertainty.
 It is necessary to measure the impact of the allele dosage uncertainty
 at the GWAS stage to understand the effects arisen from this problem at
 the association stage.
 However, MultiGWAS addresses the second challenge that is variation of
 inheritance mechanisms by using different four existing software: two designed
 for polysomic inheritance (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rosyara2016,Shen2016"

\end_inset

) together with two for disomic inheritance (

 Thus it is a useful tool for researchers because it looks for significative

\begin_layout Itemize
In genetic association studies the underlying genetic model of inheritance
 of the genetic determinant of a trait is not always known with certainty
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In genetic association studies, it is common practice to assume an additive
 model when the model of the genetic determinant of interest is unknown
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Up to date, there is often no concrete evidence of the genetic mode of inheritan
ce in the studies of complex disease genes.
 Most studies test multiple genetic models to explore the biological rationale
 behind the preference of these genetic models

Moreover, GWASpoly (

) offers models for different types of polyploid gene action 
\color blue
including
\color inherit
 general, additive, simplex dominant, and duplex dominant.
 On the other hand, TASSEL (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Bradbury2007"

) also models different types of gene action for diploids 
\color blue
including
\color inherit
 general, additive, and dominant.
 
\color blue
We propose an automatic selection of the gene action model for both tools
 based on a balance between three criteria: the inflation factor, the replicabil
ity of identified SNPs and the significance of identified SNPs.
 
\color inherit
We inform the user of the selected model based on the automatic strategy;
 we consider this information helps to understand the gene action model
 for the trait of interest.
 Even though the main focus is on the resultant SNPs, the model has assumptions
 that reflect the gene actions for a specific phenotype.

Replicability is a strategy to assess results derived from different methods.
 MultiGWAS integrates results to check for replicability in the results
 from different software.
 By combining results, we can compare the outputs and look for coincidences.
 Some software are more sensible, and others are more specific, but the
 integration allows MultiGWAS to balance specificity and sensitivity.

We provide the user with different graphic outputs to help to interpret
 the results.
 We report the SNP profile for the SNPs identified by more than one software.
 The SNP profile gives the researcher visual feedback from the SNP.
 We previously check for significative SNPs based on the 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
; however, it is essential to go back to the data and check if the SNP is
 a real association between the genotype and phenotype.
 For this purpose, we designed the SNP profile.
