Tables and Venn diagrams for single and shared SNPs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS provides tabular and graphic views to report the best-ranked and significant SNPs identified by the four GWAS packages in an integrative way (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Table-Shared-SNPs"

\end_inset

). Both 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 and significance levels have been scaled as 
\begin_inset Formula $-log_{10}(\mathB{p-value})$
\end_inset

 to give high scores to the best statistically evaluated SNPs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, best-ranked SNPs correspond to the top-scored 
\emph on
N
\emph default
 SNPs, whether they were assessed significant or not by its package, and with
\emph on
 N
\emph default
 defined by the user in the configuration file. These SNPs appears in both a SNPs table (Figure

reference "fig:Table-Shared-SNPs"

\end_inset

.a), and in a Venn diagram (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Table-Shared-SNPs"

\end_inset

.b). The table lists them by package and sorts by decreasing score, whereas the Venn diagram emphasizes if they were best-ranked either in a single package or in several at once (shared).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, the significant SNPs correspond to the ones valued statistically significant by each package. They appear in a Venn diagram (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Table-Shared-SNPs"

\end_inset

.c), and in the SNPs table, marked with significance TRUE (T) in the table of the Figure

\series bold
Shared SNPs Views. 
\series default
 Tabular and graphical views of SNP associations identified by one or more GWAS packages (shared SNPs). SNPs identified by all packages are marker with red background in all figures. 
\series bold
(a)
\series default
 Table with details of the N=9 best-ranked SNPs from each GWAS package. Each row corresponds to a single SNP, and the nine columns are tool name, the model used by the tool, genomic control factor (inflation factor), SNP name, chromosome, position in the genome, 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
, score as 
\begin_inset Formula $-log_{10}(\mathB{p-value})$
\end_inset

, significance threshold as 
\begin_inset Formula $-log_{10}(\alpha/m)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the significance level, and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the number of tested markers, and significance as true (T) or false (F) whether score > threshold or not. 
\series bold
(b)
\series default
 Venn diagram of the N=9 best-ranked SNPs. SNPs identified by all packages are in the central intersection. Other SNPs identified by more than one packages are in both upper central and lower central intersections. 
\series bold
(c)
\series default
 Venn diagram of the significant SNPs (score > threshold).
