In terms of the effects of input data quantity on GWAS results, it is both
 program and measurement specific.
 One can expect a linearly increasing relationship between input quantity
 and numbers of SNPs passing a threshold for PLINK, but no guarantee for
 TASSEL, FaST-LMM, and GAPIT.
 Viewed alternatively, it appears that the latter three programs are less
 robust to a reduction in the amount of input.
 The experimental results also suggest that setting a threshold p- or q-value
 for significant SNPs should be program specific.

New analysis based on the same raw dataset, with different parameters and

 In this case, only the raw dataset (and indirectly the data source and
 the retrieval methodology) are reused.
 This would also fall in “use a different method” and “use the existing
 datasets”, according to Gomez et al.
 (2010).
 In this case the research team benefits from an already collected raw dataset
 for performing a study that can be significantly different from the original.
 However, it could also look for the same type of results, but following
 a completely different path.
 Being able of reusing the results dataset would allow for easy comparison.

The biggest concern regarding GWAS results has been the lack of replication
 of genotype–phenotype associations in an independent study.
 But an equally formidable challenge is to ensure that a replication study
 has sufficient statistical power to detect the initial finding.
 Accordingly, meta-analysis and data imputation procedures can help to tackle
 this type of challenge.

Because of the difficulties of specifying a significance threshold in genome-wid

 ultimate proof of association must come from replication of significantly
 associated SNPs in independent samples (14).
 Even for SNPs near genes that constitute strong biological candidates,
 from previous experimental studies or simi- lar Mendelian traits, replication
 is still necessary for convincing association.

 The ultimate arbiter of a GWAS result is whether it can be replicated independe
ntly.
 It’s important to remember that this doesn’t just mean independent samples
 (though that’s crucial) but also using an independent technology.
 That way, any QC problems or confounders which affected the original study
 won’t affect the replication.

Thus, the sine qua non for belief in any specific result from a genomewide

 For computational work, this would mean using different software, running

easyGWAS: A Cloud-Based Platform for Comparing the Results of Genome-Wide

\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The ever-growing availability of high-quality genotypes for a multitude
 of species has enabled researchers to explore the underlying genetic architectu
re of complex phenotypes at an unprecedented level of detail using genome-wide
 association studies (GWAS).
 The systematic comparison of results obtained from GWAS of different traits
 opens up new possibilities, including the analysis of pleiotropic effects.
 Other advantages that result from the integration of multiple GWAS are
 the ability to replicate GWAS signals and to increase statistical power
 to detect such signals through meta-analyses.
 In order to facilitate the simple comparison of GWAS results, we present
 easyGWAS, a powerful, species-independent online resource for computing,
 storing, sharing, annotating, and comparing GWAS.
 The easyGWAS tool supports multiple species, the uploading of private genotype
 data and summary statistics of existing GWAS, as well as advanced methods
 for comparing GWAS results across different experiments and data sets in
 an interactive and user-friendly interface.
 easyGWAS is also a public data repository for GWAS data and summary statistics
 and already includes published data and results from several major GWAS.
 We demonstrate the potential of easyGWAS with a case study of the model
 organism Arabidopsis thaliana, using flowering and growth-related traits.

Three different methods are available in GWASpoly for establishing a p-value
 detection threshold for statisti- cal significance.
 The first is the Bonferroni correction, which uses a threshold of a/m to
 ensure the genome- wide type I error with m markers is no greater than
 a.
 The second approach is the random permutation test, in which phenotypes
 are randomly permuted to explicitly construct the genome-wide null distribution
 of p-values (Churchill and Doerge, 1994).
 The third option uses the qvalue package (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003)
 to control the genome-wide false discovery rate (rather than Type I error
 = probability of false positive).
 For the simulations, due to their computationally intensive nature, we
 used the Bonferroni correction with a = 0.05.
 For the analysis of the real potato data, we used the permutation test
 with 1000 permutations and genome-wide a = 0.05.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In a traditional (univariate) genome-wide association study, a measure of
 association or statistical dependence between each individual SNP and the
 phenotype is computed.
 Then a p-value is derived for each association score, which represents
 the probability of observing an association signal of the same strength
 or stronger under the null hypothesis of no association between the SNP
 and the phenotype.
 If the p-value falls below a predefined significance threshold α, commonly
 0.01 or 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected, which means that there is
 an association between the SNP and the phenotype.
 Despite the strong evidence against the null hypothesis in this case, there
 remains a chance of α∗ 100% that the low p-value is purely due to random
 chance and that the detected association is therefore a false positive
 result.
 Avoiding false positive findings is among the major challenges in GWAS.

The first is the Manhattan plot, which plots the P value of each variant
 against its position (see the figure).
 The x-axis represents the genomic location.
 The y-axis is the –log(P value).
 The logarithmic scale is used so that the most significant single-nucleotide
 polymorphisms (SNPs) stand out with higher values than the majority of
 non-significant SNPs.
 A reference line is used on the y-axis to reflect genome-wide significance,
 occasionally with a second line to represent a ‘suggestive significance’
 threshold.
 Owing to the expectation of linkage disequilibrium (LD), a single highly
 significant SNP on its own is often interpreted as a genotyping error.
 Columns of significant SNPs in LD with the truly causal variant are seen
 in human studies, although this expectation is dependent on the LD of the
 organism.

In a Manhattan plot [42], each dot corresponds to one genetic marker (SNP).
 Its genetic location is indicated on the x-axis, and the –log10 of its
 p-value on the y-axis (see plots in second column of Fig.
 3a–d).
 This transformation results in SNPs with low p- values (and therefore stronger
 association) to have high values on the y-axis.
 Due to LD, SNPs in close proximity to each other show similar association
 to the phenotype, resulting in spikes in close proximity to SNPs with low
 p-values.
 This resembles the Manhattan skyline and gave rise to the term Manhattan

Departure of observed SNP P values from the y = x reference line may reflect
 systematic inflation in the test statistics owing to population stratification.
 However, a departure from this line is also expected for a truly polygenic
 trait, as many causal SNPs may not yet have reached genome-wide significance
 owing to a lack of power.

This will lead to an excess of low P values across all SNPs.

 the y = x distribution that is important.

gives a measure of the inflation in the sample.
 This should be 1 in the case of the null and is generally seen as inflation
 if above 1.05.
 The lambda value can be weighted by sample size to avoid polygenic inflation,
 as larger samples have the power to detect inflation owing to many SNPs
 of small effect.
 In this case, λ1000 is used to get an inflation estimate proportional to
 a GWAS that contained only 1,000 samples.

 False negatives occur when the statistical signal of the marker is not

 Possible reasons for this are (a) little evidence in the data to support

A common way to assess the degree of population structure in the data is
 to compute the genomic inflation factor λGC [55].
 It describes the deviation of the median of the observed test statistics
 from the median of the expected test statistics.
 Since the distribution of the test statistics under the null hypothesis
 is known (either because there is a closed form representation, or because
 it has been derived empirically using permutation testing), so is its median.
 Considering the assumption that most of the SNPs are not associated with
 the trait, λGC should be close to one if no confounder is present [56].
 If λGC is inflated (larger than 1) or deflated (lower than 1), a correction
 for population structure is recommended to avoid false positives or false
 negatives, respectively.
 The inflation or deflation of p-values can be easily visualized in a Q-Q
