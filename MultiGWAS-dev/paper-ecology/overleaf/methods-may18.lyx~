Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MultiGWAS tool has three main consecutive steps: the adjustment, the multi analysis, and finally, the integration (Fig. 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "pipeline"

\end_inset

). In the adjustment step, MultiGWAS processes the configuration file. Then it cleans and filters the genotype and phenotype, and MultiGWAS "diploidize" the genomic data. Then, during the multi analysis, each GWAS tool runs in parallel. Finally, in the integration step, the MultiGWAS tool scans the output files from the four packages (i.e., GWASPoly, SHEsis, PLink, and TASSEL). It generates a summary of all results that contains score tables, Venn diagrams, SNP profiles, and Manhattan plots.

Adjustment stage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS takes as input a configuration file where the user specifies the genomics data along with the parameters that will be used by the four tools. Once the configuration file is processed, MultiGWAS preprocess the data by cleaning, filtering, and checking data quality. The output of this stage corresponds to the inputs for the four programs at the Multi Analysis stage.

Input genotype and phenotype files:

Currently, MultiGWAS uses two input files, one for genotype and the other for the phenotype. Both data correspond to data matrices with column and row names (Figure

\end_inset

). The genotype file format uses SNP markers in rows and samples in columns (Figure

a). The phenotype file format uses samples in rows and traits in columns (Figure

\begin_layout Paragraph
Quality Control:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A control step is necessary to check the input data for genotype or phenotype errors or poor quality that can lead to spurious GWAS results. MultiGWAS uses the following filters to control the data quality: Minor Allele Frequency (MAF), individual missing rate (MIND), SNP missing rate (GENO), and Hardy\SpecialChar softhyphen
Weinberg threshold (HWE).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MAF of {x} filters out SNPs with minor allele frequency below {x} (default 0.01); MIND of {x} filters out all individuals with missing genotypes exceeding {x}*100% (default 0.1); GENO {x} filters out SNPs with missing values exceeding {x}*100% (default 0.1); and HWE filters out SNPs which have Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium exact test 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 below the {x} threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS does the MAF filtering. We use the PLINK package 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for the other three filters: MIND, GENO, and HWE. Once we have the samples and SNPs that pass the filters, then we generate an input file for each package used.

. Many of low 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 associations, closer to being significant, are discarded due to the stringent significance levels, and consequently increasing the number of false negatives. To help to analyze both significant and non-significant associations, MultiGWAS provides the option to specify the number of best-ranked associations, adding the corresponding 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 to each association found. In this way, it is possible to enlarge the number of results, and we can observe replicability in the results for different programs. Nevertheless, we present each association with the corresponding

\begin_layout Standard
Once the configuration file is processed, the genomic data is read and cleaned by selecting individuals present in both genotype and phenotype and excluding individuals and SNPs that have poor quality. MultiGWAS applies four quality control filters commonly used in GWAS analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, the format "ACGT" suitable for the polyploid software GWASpoly and SHEsis, is "diploidized" for PLINK and TASSEL. The homozygous tetraploid genotypes are converted to diploid thus: (e.g.,AAAA→AA, CCCC→CC, GGGG→GG, TTTT→TT). Moreover, for tetraploid heterozygous genotypes, the conversion depends on the reference and alternate alleles calculated for each position (e.g., AAAT→AT, ... ,CCCG→CG). After this process, MultiGWAS transform the genomic data into the formats required for each software.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We present several reports. For each tool, first a QQ plot that asses the resultant p-values. Second, a Manhattan plot for each tool with two lines, blue and red, respectively, is the lower limit for the best ranked and significative SNPs. We present two Venn diagrams, one for the significative SNPs and one for N best-ranked SNPs of each tool. We show the results for GWAspoly, PLINK, TASSEL, and SHEsis in red, green, yellow, and blue, respectively. Moreover, for each SNP that is in the intersection; thus, that is predicted by more than one tool we provide SNP profile.

At this stage, We integrate the results to evaluate reproducible results among tools (Fig

). But, We still report a summary for the results of each tool:

\begin_layout Standard
To present the replicability, we use two sets: (1) the set of all the significative SNPs provided by each tool and (2) the set of all the best-ranked SNPs. For each set, we present a Venn diagram that shows SNPs predicted exclusively by one tool and intersections that help to identify the SNPs predicted by one, two, three, or all the tools. In addition, we provide detailed tables for the two sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each SNP predicted more than once, we provide what we call the SNP profile. That is a heat diagram for a specific SNP, where each column is a genotype state AAAA, AAAB, AABB, ABBBB, BBBBB. And each row corresponds to a sample. Samples with close genotypes form together clusters. Thus to generate the clusters, we do not use the phenotype information. However, we present the phenotype information in the figure as the color. This figure visually provides information regarding genotype and phenotype information simultaneously for the whole population. We present colors as tones between white and black for color blind people.

MultiGWAS generates a report, one document with the content previously described. Besides, there is a folder with the individual figures just in case the user needs one. In the supplementary information, we include a report and a description of the report content
