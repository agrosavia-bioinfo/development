One challenge in applying GWAS to polyploid species is how to define a relatedne
ss metric between polyploid individuals (i.e., how to generate the kinship
 matrix, K).
 So far, there have been two software tools released for polyploid GWAS,
 namely the R package GWASpoly (Rosyara et al., 2016) and the previously
 mentioned SHEsisPlus (Shen et al., 2016).
 Of these, only GWASpoly looks critically at the form of the kinship matrix
 K.
 Three different forms of K were tested in the development of the package,
 with the canonical relationship matrix (VanRaden, 2008) [termed the realized
 relationship matrix by the authors (Rosyara et al., 2016)] found to best
 control against inflation of significance values.
 This is also the default K provided in the GWASpoly package.
 An alternative approach to GWAS mapping for polyploids is provided by the
 netgwas package (Behrouzi and Wit, 2017b), previously mentioned for its
 linkage mapping capacity.
 Again, graphical models form the basis of the approach, which goes beyond
 single-marker association mapping to investigate genotype-phenotype interaction
s using all markers simultaneously in a graph structure.
 There is almost no discussion on how confoundedness between population
 structure and phenotypes are handled, but the authors claim the detection
 of false positive associations is not problematic.

Eight gene action models were tested for the tetraploid genotype calling:
 general, additive, simplex dominant alternative (simplex-dom-alt), simplex
 dominant reference (simplex-dom-ref), duplex dominant alternative (duplex-dom-a
lt), duplex dominant reference (duplex-dom-ref), diplo-additive, and diplo-gener
al.
 According to Rosyara et al.
 (2016), the general type of genetic model allows the SNP effect for each
 genotypic class to be arbitrary and statistically equivalent.
 In the additive model the SNP effect is proportional to the dosage of the
 minor allele.
 In the simplex dominant models, all the heterozygotes (AAAB, AABB, ABBB)
 are equivalent to one of the homozygotes (AAAA or BBBB).
 In the duplex dominant models, the duplex state (AABB) has the same effect
 as either the simplex (AAAB) and nulliplex (AAAA) or the triplex (ABBB)
 and quadriplex (BBBB) states.
 In the diploidized models (diplo), all heterozygous classes have the same
 effect, resembling a traditional diploid dosage model (AA, AB, BB), and
 have gene action models encompassing the general and additive effects.
 The diploid genotype calling was also used for GWAS analyses, using the
 following gene actions: diplo-general, diplo-additive, simplex-dom-alt,
 and simplex-dom-ref.
