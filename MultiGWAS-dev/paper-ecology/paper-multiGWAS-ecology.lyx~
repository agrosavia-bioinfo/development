MultiGWAS: A tool for GWAS analysis on tetraploid organisms by integrating
 four GWAS software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

Summary:
\series default
 The Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are essential to determine the
 association between genetic variants across individuals.
 One way to support the results is by using different tools to validate
 the reproducibility of the associations.
 Currently, software for GWAS in diploids is well-established but for polyploids
 species is scarce.
 Each GWAS software has its characteristics, which can cost time and effort
 to use them successfully.
 Here, we present MultiGWAS, a tool

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\color blue
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are
\color inherit
 used to identify which variants through the whole genome of a large number
 of individuals are associated with a specific trait (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cantor2010prioritizing, begum2012comprehensive"

\end_inset

).
 This methodology started with humans and several model plants, such as
 rice, maize, and

 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lauc2010genomics, tian2011genome, cao2011whole, korte2013advantages, han2013sequencing"

\end_inset

).
 Because of the advances in the next-gen sequencing technology and the decline
 of the sequencing cost in recent years, there is an increase in the availabilit
y of genome sequences of different organisms at a faster rate (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ekblom2011applications, ellegren2014genome"

\end_inset

).
 Thus, the GWAS is becoming the standard tool to understand the genetic
 bases of either ecological or economic phenotypic variation for both model
 and non-model organisms.
 This increment in GWAS includes complex species such as polyploids (Fig.

\begin_layout Standard
The GWAS for polyploid species has three related challenges.
 First, as all GWAS, we should replicate the study as a reliable method
 to validate the results and recognize real associations.
 This replication involves finding the same associations either in several
 replicates from the study population using the

 This approach involved the use of different parameters, models, or conditions,
 to test how consistent the results are (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "De2014,Pearson2008"

\end_inset

).
 However, the performance of different

GWAS software could affect the results.
 For example, the threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $pvalue$
\end_inset

 for SNP significance change through four GWAS software (i.e., PLINK, TASSEL,
 GAPIT, and FaST-LMM) when sample size varies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yan2019"

\end_inset

).
 It means that well-ranked SNPs from one package can be ranked differently
 in another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, although there are many GWAS software available to repeat the analysis
 under different conditions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gumpinger2018"

\end_inset

), most of them are designed exclusively for the diploid data matrix (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bourke2018"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, it is often necessary to "diploidizing" the polyploid genomic
 data in order to replicate the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, there are very few tools focused on the integration of several GWAS
 software, to make comparisons under different parameters and conditions
 across them.
 As far as we know, there is only two software with this service in mind,
 such as iPAT and easyGWAS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The iPAT allows running in a graphic interface three well-known command-line
 GWAS software such as GAPIT, PLINK, and FarmCPU (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zhang2018"

\end_inset

) .
 However, the output from each package is separated.
 On the other hand, the easyGWAS allows running a GWAS analysis on the web
 using different algorithms.
 This analysis could run independently of both the computer capacity and
 operating system.
 However, it needs either several datasets available or a dataset with a
 large number of individuals to make replicates in order to compare among
 algorithms.
 Moreover, the output from different algorithms is separated (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Grimm2017"

\end_inset

).
 Thus, for both software iPAT and easyGWAS, the integrative and comparative
 outputs among software or algorithms are missing.

 we developed the MultiGWAS tool that performs GWAS analyses for tetraploid
 species using four software in parallel.
 Our tool include GWASpoly (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rosyara2016"

\end_inset

) and the SHEsis tool (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) and TASSEL (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bradbury2007"

\end_inset

) with the use of a "diploidized" genomic matrix.
 The tool deals with 
\color blue
input file formats, data preprocessing, search for associations by running
\color inherit
 four GWAS tools in parallel, and 
\color blue
creation of
\color inherit
 comparative reports from the output of each software to help the user to
 decide more intuitively the true or false associations.

\begin_layout Section
Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MultiGWAS tool has three main consecutive steps: the adjustment, the
 multi analysis, and the integration (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Pipeline"

\end_inset

).
 In the adjustment step, MultiGWAS processes the configuration file, cleans
 and filters the genotype and phenotype, and "diploidize" the genomic data.
 Then, during the multi analysis, each GWAS tool runs in parallel.
 Finally, in the integration step, the MultiGWAS tool scans the output files
 from the four packages (i.e., GWASPoly, SHEsis, PLink, and TASSEL).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS generates a summary of all results that contains the following
 tabular and graphical visualizations: score tables with detailed information
 of associations, shared SNPs visualization using Venn diagrams, SNP profiles
 using heatmaps, associations visualizations using Manhattan and QQ plots,
 and chromosomes vs SNP visualizations using chord diagrams.

 Once the configuration file is read and processed, the genomic data files
 (genotype and phenotype) are then cleaned, filtered, and checked for data
 quality.
 The output of this stage corresponds to the inputs for the four programs

GWAS model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is designed to work with quantitative phenotypes and can run GWAS
 analysis using two types of statistical models that we have called 
\emph on
full
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
naive
\emph default
 models.
 The 
\emph on
full model
\emph default
 is known in the literature as the Q+K model (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yu2006"

\end_inset

) and includes a control for structure (Q) and relatedness between samples
 (K).
 In contrast, the 
\emph on
naive model
\emph default
 does not include any type of correction.
 Both models are linear regression approaches, and each one of the four
 GWAS packages used in MultiGWAS has some variations of those models.
 The 
\emph on
naive
\emph default
 is modeled with Generalized Linear Models (GLMs, Phenotype + Genotype),
 and the 
\emph on
full
\emph default
 is modeled with Mixed Linear Models (MLMs, Phenotype + Genotype + Structure
 + Kinship).
 The default model used by MultiGWAS is the 
\emph on
full model
\emph default
 (Q+K) (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yu2006"

\end_inset

), following the equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=X\beta+S\alpha+Q\nu+Z\mu+e
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this equation, the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is the vector of observed phenotypes.
 Moreover, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is a vector of fixed effects other than SNP or population group effects,
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is a vector of SNP effects (Quantitative Trait Nucleotides), the 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is a vector of population effects, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is a vector of polygene background effects, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 is a vector of residual effects.
 Besides, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, modeled as a fixed effect, refers to the incidence matrix for subpopulation
 covariates relating 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 are incidence matrices of 1s and 0s relating 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Genome-wide significance: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GWAS searches SNPs associated with the phenotype in a statistically significant
 manner.
 A threshold or significance level 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is specified and compared with the 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 derived for each association score.
 Standard significance levels are 0.01 or 0.05 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gumpinger2018,Rosyara2016"

\end_inset

), and MultiGWAS uses an 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 of 0.05 for the four GWAS packages.
 However, in GWASpoly and TASSEL, which calculates the SNP effect for each
 genotypic class using different gene action models (see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Multi analysis stage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), the threshold is adjusted according to each of those two packages.
 Therefore, the number of tested markers
\emph on
 
\emph default
may be different in each model (see below), impacting the 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 thresholds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Multiple testing correction:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the massive number of statistical tests performed by GWAS, it is
 necessary to perform a correction method for multiple hypothesis testing
 and adjusting the 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 threshold accordingly.
 Two standard methods for multiple hypothesis testing are the false discovery
 rate (FDR) and the Bonferroni correction.
 The latter is the default method used by MultiGWAS, which is one of the
 most rigorous methods.
 However, instead of adjusting the 
\emph on
p-values,
\emph default
 MultiGWAS adjust the threshold below which a 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 is considered significant.
 That is 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha/m$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the significance level and 
\emph on
m 
\emph default
is the number of tested markers from the genotype matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Number of reported associations: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Criticism has arisen, considering only statistically significant associations
 as possible correct associations (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Thomson2011, Kaler2019"

\end_inset

).
 Many low 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 associations, closer to being significant, are discarded due to the stringent
 significance levels, which consequently increases the number of false negatives.
 To avoid this problem, MultiGWAS provides the option to specify the number
 of best-ranked associations (lower 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
), adding the corresponding 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
 to each association found.
 In this way, it is possible to enlarge the number of results, and their
 replicability across the different programs.
 Nevertheless, the report displays each association with its corresponding
 
\emph on
p-value
\emph default
.

\begin_layout Standard
A control step is necessary to check the input data for the genotype or
 phenotype errors or poor quality that can lead to spurious GWAS results.
 MultiGWAS provides the option to select and define thresholds for the following
 filters that control the data quality: Minor Allele Frequency (MAF), individual
 missing rate (MIND), SNP missing rate (GENO), and Hardy-Weinberg threshold
 (HWE):

Data preprocessing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the configuration file is processed, the genomic data is read and cleaned
 by selecting individuals present in both genotype and phenotype.
 Then, MultiGWAS removes individuals and SNPs with poor quality following
 the previous selected quality-control filters and their thresholds,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, the format "ACGT" suitable for the polyploid software GWASpoly
 and SHEsis, is "diploidized" for PLINK and TASSEL.
 The homozygous tetraploid genotypes are converted to diploid thus: AAAA→AA,
 CCCC→CC, GGGG→GG, TTTT→TT.
 Moreover, for tetraploid heterozygous genotypes, the conversion depends
 on the reference and alternate alleles calculated for each position (e.g.,
 AAAT →AT, ...
 ,CCCG→CG).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this process, MultiGWAS converts the genomic data, genotype, and phenotype
 datasets to the specific formats required for each of the four GWAS packages.

GWASpoly
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GWASpoly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is an R package designed for GWAS in polyploid species used in several
 studies in plants 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Berdugo2017,Ferrao2018,Sharma2018,Yuan2019"

\end_inset

.
 GWASpoly uses a Q+K linear mixed model with biallelic SNPs that account
 for population structure and relatedness.
 
\color blue
Also, to calculate the SNP effect for each genotypic class, GWASpoly provides
 eight gene action models: general, additive, simplex dominant alternative,
 simplex dominant reference, duplex dominant alternative, and duplex dominant.
 As a consequence, the number of statistical test performed can be different
 in each action model and so thresholds below which the 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 are considered significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using GWASpoly version 1.3, 
\color blue
employing all gene action models to find associations and repoting the top
 
\emph on
N 
\emph default
best-ranked (the SNPs with lowest 
\emph on
p-values)
\emph default
, where 
\emph on
N
\emph default
 is defined by the user in the input configuration file.

\color inherit
 The 
\emph on
full 
\emph default
model used by GWASpoly includes the population structure and relatedness,
 which are estimated using the first five principal components and the kinship
 matrix, respectively, both calculated with the GWASpoly built-in algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
SHEsis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SHEsis is another program designed for polyploid species that includes single
 locus association analysis, among others.
 It is based on a linear regresion model, and it has been used in some studies
 of animals and humans 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Qiao2015,Meng2019"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using the version 1.0 which does not take account for population
 structure or relatedness, however MultiGWAS externally estimates relatedness
 for SHEsis by excluding individuals with cryptic first-degree relatedness
 using the algorithm implemented in PLINK 2.0 (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
PLINK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PLINK is one of the most extensively used programs for GWAS in diploids
 species.
 It was developed for humans but it is applicable to any species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Power2016"

\end_inset

.
 PLINK includes a range of analysis, including univariate GWAS using two-sample
 tests and linear regression models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using two versions of PLINK: 1.9 and 2.0.
 Linear regression from PLINK 1.9 is used to achieve both types of analysis,
 naive and full.
 For the full analysis, population structure is estimated using the first
 five principal components calculated with the PLINK 1.9 built in algorithm.
 But relatedness is estimated from the kinship coefficients calculated with
 the PLINK 2.0 built in algorithm, removing the close relatives or individuals
 with first-degree relatedness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
TASSEL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TASSEL is another common GWAS program based on the Java software.
 It was developed for maize and it has been used in several studies in plants
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Alvarez2017,Zhang2018"

\end_inset

, but like PLINK, it is applicable to any species.
 For association analysis, TASSEL includes the general lineal model (GLM)
 and mixed linear model (MLM) that accounts for population structure and
 relatedness.
 
\color blue
And, in the same manner that GWASPoly, TASSEL provides three gene action
 models to calculate the SNP effect of each genotypc class: general, additive,
 and dominant, and so the significance threshold depends of each action
 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using TASSEL 5.0, 
\color blue
with all gene action models used to find the 
\emph on
N 
\emph default
best-ranked associations and reporting the top 
\emph on
N 
\emph default
best-ranked associations (SNPs with lowest 
\emph on
p-values)
\emph default
.

\color inherit
 Naive GWAS is achieved by the GLM, and full GWAS is achieved by the MLM
 with two parameters: population structure that uses the first five principal
 components, and relatedness that uses the kinship matrix with centered
 IBS method, both calculated with the TASSEL built-in algorithms.

The outputs resulting from the four GWAS packages are scanned and processed

 lower than and close to a significance threshold, respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Calculation of 
\emph on
p-values 
\emph default
and significance thresholds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GWAS packages compute 
\emph on
p-value 
\emph default
as a measure of association between each individual SNP and the trait of
 interest.
 The SNPs are considered statistically significant, and so possible true
 associations, when their 
\emph on
p-value 
\emph default
drops below a predefined significance threshold.
 But, most GWAS packages compute differently 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 with the possibility to compute them too high or too low.
 If 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 are too high, then it would lead to false negatives or SNPs with true associati
ons with the phenotype but that does not reach the significance threshold.
 Conversely, if 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 are too low, then it would lead to false positives or SNPs with false associati
ons with the phenotype but that reaches the significance threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To overcome these difficulties, in the case of too high 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
, MultiGWAS identifies and reports both significant and best-ranked associations
 (the ones closer to being statistically significant).
 Whereas, in the case of too low 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
, MultiGWAS provides two methods for adjusting 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 and significance threshold: the false discovery rate (FDR) that adjust
 
\emph on
p-values, 
\emph default
and the Bonferroni correction, that adjusts the threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, MultiGWAS uses the Bonferroni correction in which the significance
 threshold is adjusted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha/m$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the significance level defined by the user in the configuration file,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the number of tested markers in the GWAS study.
 However, the significance threshold can be different for each GWAS package
 as some of them use several action models to calculate the SNP effect of
 each genotypic class.
 For both PLINK and SHEsis packages, which use only one model, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is equal to the total number of SNPs, but for both GWASpoly and TASSEL
 packages, which use eight and three gene action models, respectively, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is equal to the number of test performed in each model, which is different
 between models.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Selection of significant and best-ranked associations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS selects two groups of associations from the results of each GWAS
 package: statistically significant and best-ranked.
 The latter equally important to the former as they are associations with
 lowest 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 not reaching the significance threshold but representing interesting associatio
ns for further analysis (possible false negatives).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The significant associations are selected from the ones with 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 falling below a significant threshold, calculated for each GWAS package;
 and the best-ranked associations are selected as the closest 
\emph on
N
\emph default
 to being statistically significant, with 
\emph on
N
\emph default
 defined by the user in the configuration file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selection of these groups takes into account whether the GWAS package
 uses only one gene action model, as PLINK and SHEsis do, or uses several
 ones, as GWASpoly and TASSEL do.
 In the first case, there is only one resulting set of associations and
 the selection is straighforward, as described above.
 However, in the second case, there are several resulting sets of associations,
 one for each model, and MultiGWAS selects both groups of associations by
 choosing the gene action model with the highest number of shared SNPs and
 with the inflation factor closest to one, according to the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
score(M_{i})=\frac{\sum\limits _{j=1}^{k}{\textstyle sharedSNPs(M_{i},M_{j})}}{k*N}+1-|1-\lambda(M_{i})|
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $score(M_{i})$
\end_inset

 is the score for the gene action model 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $1..k$
\end_inset

, for a GWAS package with 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 gene action models; 
\begin_inset Formula $sharedSNPs(M_{i},M_{j})$
\end_inset

 is the number of shared SNPs between models 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{j}$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of closest SNPs to being statistically significant, as it
 was described above; and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(M_{i})$
\end_inset

 is the inflation factor for the model 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The score is high when a model 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 both identifies a high number of shared SNPs and has an inflation factor
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 close to 1.
 Conversely, the score is low when the model 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 both identifies a small number of shared SNPs and has an inflation factor
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 either low (close to 0) or high (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda>2$
\end_inset

 ).
 In any other case, the score is balanced between the number of shared SNPs
 and the inflation factor.

Results

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the GWAS packages used by MultiGWAS are based on a linear regression
 approaches, but they often produce dissimilar association results for the
 same input.
 For example, computed 
\emph on
p-values 
\emph default
for the same set of SNPs are different between packages; SNPs with significant
 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 for one package may be not significant for the others; or well-ranked SNPs
 in one package may be ranked differently in another.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To alleviate these difficulties, MultiGWAS produces five types of outputs

 Second, the significant SNPs (Figure

 three SNPs, c1_8019, c2_25471, and c2_45606, of which the c1_8019 was also
 the most significant association found in the same potato dataset analyzed

Manhattan and QQ plots for GWAS associations 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS uses classical Manhattan and Quantile–Quantile plots (QQ plots)
 to visualize the results of each package.
 In both plots, the points are the SNPs and their p-values are transformed
 into scores like 
\begin_inset Formula $-log_{10}(\mathB{p-values})$
\end_inset

 (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:view-qqmanhattan"

\end_inset

).
 The Manhattan plot shows the strength of association of the SNPs (y-axis)
 distributed at their genomic location (x-axis), so the higher the score,
 the stronger the association.
 While the QQ plot compares the expected distribution of 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 (y-axis) with the observed distribution (x-axis)..

Similar to the importance of avoiding false positive findings in GWAS, it
 is equally crucial to avoid missing true associations, the so-called false
 negatives.
 False negatives occur when the statistical signal of the marker is not
 strong enough to reach genome- wide significance.
 Possible reasons for this are (a) little evidence in the data to support
 the statistical association, e.g., because of a small sample size, or (b)
 the significance threshold being too low.

MultiGWAS creates a two-dimensional representation, called SNP profile,
 to visualize each trait by individuals and genotypes as rows and columns,
 respectively (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 At the left, the individuals are grouped in a dendrogram by their genotype.
 At the right, there is the name or ID of each individual.
 At the bottom, the genotypes are ordered from left to right, starting from
 the major to the minor allele (i.e., AAAA, AAAB, AABB, ABBB, BBBB).
 At the top, there is a description of the trait based on a histogram of
 frequency (top left) and by an assigned color for each numerical phenotype
 value using a grayscale (top right).
 Thus, each individual appears as a colored line by its phenotype value
 on its genotype column.
 For each column, there is a solid cyan line with the mean of each column
 and a broken cyan line that indicates how far the cell deviates from the
 mean.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because each multiGWAS report shows one specific trait at a time, the histogram
 and color key will remain the same for all the best-ranked SNPs.

 (1) the data, and (2) inheritance mechanisms that are under study (

).
 The difficulties regarding the data complexity are the uncertainty in the
 allele dosage and null alleles, but these problems are opportunities to
 improve software at the variant calling stage.
 Moreover, there is an on-going understanding of the inheritance mechanisms
 for polyploids.
 For autopolyploids, most loci have a polysomic inheritance.
 However, sections of the genome that did not duplicate lead to disomic
 inheritance for some loci (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS does not face the problem of the allele dosage uncertainty.
 It is necessary to measure the impact of the allele dosage uncertainty
 at the GWAS stage to understand the effects arisen from this problem at
 the association stage.
 However, MultiGWAS addresses the second challenge variation of inheritance
 mechanisms by using different for existing software: two designed for polysomic
 inheritance (

) together with two for disomic inheritance (

 Thus it is a useful tool for researchers because it looks for significative

 On the other hand, TASSEL (

 We propose an automatic selection of the gene action model for both tools
 based on a balance between the factor of inflation and the replicability
 of the identified SNPs.
 We inform the user of the selected model based on the automatic strategy;
 we consider this information helps to understand the gene action model
 for the trait of interest.
 Even though the main focus is on the resultant SNPs, the model has assumptions
 that reflect the gene actions for a specific phenotype.
