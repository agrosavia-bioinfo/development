abstract = {The millisecond time scale needed for molecular dynamics simulations to approach the quantitative study of protein folding is not yet routine. One approach to extend the simulation time scale is to perform long simulations on specialized and expensive supercomputers such as Anton. Ideally, however, folding simulations would be more economical while retaining reasonable accuracy, and provide feedback on structure, stability and function rapidly enough if partnered directly with experiment. Approaches to this problem typically involve varied compromises between accuracy, precision, and cost; the goal here is to address whether simple implicit solvent models have become sufficiently accurate for their weaknesses to be offset by their ability to rapidly provide much more precise conformational data as compared to explicit solvent. We demonstrate that our recently developed physics-based model performs well on this challenge, enabling accurate all-atom simulated folding for 16 of 17 proteins with a variety of sizes, secondary structure, and topologies. The simulations were carried out using the Amber software on inexpensive GPUs, providing ∼1 $\mu$s/day per GPU, and {\textgreater}2.5 ms data presented here. We also show that native conformations are preferred over misfolded structures for 14 of the 17 proteins. For the other 3, misfolded structures are thermodynamically preferred, suggesting opportunities for further improvement.},

abstract = {Motion planning is a fundamental problem in robotics that has motivated research since more than three decades ago. A large variety of algorithms have been proposed to compute feasible motions of multi-body systems in constrained workspaces. In recent years, some of these algorithms have surpassed the frontiers of robotics, finding applications in other domains such as industrial manufacturing, computer animation and computational structural biology. This paper concerns the latter domain, providing a survey on motion planning algorithms applied to molecular modeling and simulation. Both the algorithmic and application sides are discussed, as well as the different issues to be taken into consideration when extending robot motion planning algorithms to deal with molecules. From an algorithmic perspective, the paper gives a general overview of the different extensions to sampling-based motion planners. From the point of view of applications, the survey deals with problems involving protein folding and conformational transitions, as well as protein–ligand interactions.},

In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.Availability:http://cd-hit.org.Contact:liwz@sdsc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {The rapid advances of high-throughput sequencing technologies dramatically prompted metagenomic studies of microbial communities that exist at various environments. Fundamental questions in metagenomics include the identities, composition and dynamics of microbial populations and their functions and interactions. However, the massive quantity and the comprehensive complexity of these sequence data pose tremendous challenges in data analysis. These challenges include but are not limited to ever-increasing computational demand, biased sequence sampling, sequence errors, sequence artifacts and novel sequences. Sequence clustering methods can directly answer many of the fundamental questions by grouping similar sequences into families. In addition, clustering analysis also addresses the challenges in metagenomics. Thus, a large redundant data set can be represented with a small non-redundant set, where each cluster can be represented by a single entry or a consensus. Artifacts can be rapidly detected through clustering. Errors can be identified, filtered or corrected by using consensus from sequences within clusters.},

abstract = {An outstanding challenge in the field of molecular biology has been to understand the process by which proteins fold into their characteristic three-dimensional structures. Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 $\mu$s and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

abstract = {The goal of the Dynameomics project is to perform, store, and analyze molecular dynamics simulations of representative proteins, of all known globularfolds, in their native state and along their unfolding pathways. To analyze unfolding simulations, the location of the protein along the unfolding reaction coordinate (RXN) must be determined. Properties such as the fraction of native contacts and radius of gyration are often used; however, there is an issue regarding degeneracy with these properties, as native and nonnative species can overlap. Here, we used 15 physical properties of the protein to construct a multidimensional-embedded, onedimensional RXN coordinate that faithfully captures the complex nature of unfolding. The unfolding RXN coordinates for 188 proteins (1534 simulations and 22.9 s in explicit water) were calculated. Native, transition, intermediate, and denatured states were readily identified with the use of this RXN coordinate. A global native ensemble based on the native-state properties of the 188 proteins was created.This ensemble was shown to be effective for calculating RXN coordinates for folds outside the initial 188 targets.These RXN coordinates enable, high-throughput assignment of conformational states, which represents an important step in comparing protein properties across fold space as well as characterizing the unfolding of individual proteins. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Motivation: Protein structure similarity is often measured by root mean squared deviation, global distance test score and template modeling score (TM-score). However, the scores themselves cannot provide information on how significant the structural similarity is. Also, it lacks a quantitative relation between the scores and conventional fold classifications. This article aims to answer two questions: (i) what is the statistical significance of TM-score? (ii) What is the probability of two proteins having the same fold given a specific TM-score?Results: We first made an all-to-all gapless structural match on 6684 non-homologous single-domain proteins in the PDB and found that the TM-scores follow an extreme value distribution. The data allow us to assign each TM-score a P-value that measures the chance of two randomly selected proteins obtaining an equal or higher TM-score. With a TM-score at 0.5, for instance, its P-value is 5.5 × 10−7, which means we need to consider at least 1.8 million random protein pairs to acquire a TM-score of no less than 0.5. Second, we examine the posterior probability of the same fold proteins from three datasets SCOP, CATH and the consensus of SCOP and CATH. It is found that the posterior probability from different datasets has a similar rapid phase transition around TM-score=0.5. This finding indicates that TM-score can be used as an approximate but quantitative criterion for protein topology classification, i.e. protein pairs with a TM-score $\backslash$$\backslash${\textgreater}0.5 are mostly in the same fold while those with a TM-score $\backslash$$\backslash${\textless}0.5 are mainly not in the same fold.Contact:zhng@umich.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {For decades, researchers have been applying computer simulation to address problems in biology. However, many of these "grand challenges" in computational biology, such as simulating how proteins fold, remained unsolved due to their great complexity. Indeed, even to simulate the fastest folding protein would require decades on the fastest modern CPUs. Here, we review novel methods to fundamentally speed such previously intractable problems using a new computational paradigm: distributed computing. By efficiently harnessing tens of thousands of computers throughout the world, we have been able to break previous computational barriers. However, distributed computing brings new challenges, such as how to efficiently divide a complex calculation of many PCs that are connected by relatively slow networking. Moreover, even if the challenge of accurately reproducing reality can be conquered, a new challenge emerges: how can we take the results of these simulations (typically tens to hundreds of gigabytes of raw data) and gain some insight into the questions at hand. This challenge of the analysis of the sea of data resulting from large-scale simulation will likely remain for decades to come.},

abstract = {In many cases, biological sequence databases contain redundant sequences that make it difficult to achieve reliable statistical analysis. Removing the redundant sequences to find all the real protein families and their representatives from a large sequences dataset is quite important in bioinformatics. The problem of removing redundant protein sequences can be modeled as finding the maximum independent set from a graph, which is a NP problem in Mathematics. This paper presents a novel program named FastCluster on the basis of mathematical graph theory. The algorithm makes an improvement to Hobohm and Sanders algorithm to generate non-redundant protein sequence sets. FastCluster uses BLAST to determine the similarity between two sequences in order to get better sequence similarity. The algorithms performance is compared with Hobohm and Sanders algorithm and it shows that Fast- Cluster can produce a reasonable non-redundant protein set and have a similarity cut-off from 0.0 to 1.0. The proposed algorithm shows its superiority in generating a larger maximal non-redundant (independent) protein set which is closer to the real result (the maximum independent set of a graph) that means all the protein families are clustered. This makes Fast- Cluster a valuable tool for removing redundant protein sequences.},

A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over timescales on the order of a millisecond---several orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations. We describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized highspeed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.},

@article{Weizhong2002,
abstract = {MOTIVATION Sequence clustering replaces groups of similar sequences in a database with single representatives. Clustering large protein databases like the NCBI Non-Redundant database (NR) using even the best currently available clustering algorithms is very time-consuming and only practical at relatively high sequence identity thresholds. Our previous program, CD-HI, clustered NR at 90{\%} identity in approximately 1 h and at 75{\%} identity in approximately 1 day on a 1 GHz Linux PC (Li et al., Bioinformatics, 17, 282, 2001); however even faster clustering speed is needed because the size of protein databases are rapidly growing and many applications desire a lower attainable thresholds. RESULTS For our previous algorithm (CD-HI), we have employed short-word filters to speed up the clustering. In this paper, we show that tolerating some redundancy makes for more efficient use of these short-word filters and increases the program's speed 100 times. Our new program implements this technique and clusters NR at 70{\%} identity within 2 h, and at 50{\%} identity in approximately 5 days. Although some redundancy is present after clustering, our new program's results only differ from our previous program's by less than 0.4{\%}.},

@article{Hobohm1992,
abstract = {The Protein Data Bank currently contains about 600 data sets of three-dimensional protein coordinates determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. There is considerable redundancy in the data base, as many protein pairs are identical or very similar in sequence. However, statistical analyses of protein sequence-structure relations require nonredundant data. We have developed two algorithms to extract from the data base representative sets of protein chains with maximum coverage and minimum redundancy. The first algorithm focuses on optimizing a particular property of the selected proteins and works by successive selection of proteins from an ordered list and exclusion of all neighbors of each selected protein. The other algorithm aims at maximizing the size of the selected set and works by successive thinning out of clusters of similar proteins. Both algorithms are generally applicable to other data bases in which criteria of similarity can be defined and relate to problems in graph theory. The largest nonredundant set extracted from the current release of the Protein Data Bank has 155 protein chains. In this set, no two proteins have sequence similarity higher than a certain cutoff (30{\%} identical residues for aligned subsequences longer than 80 residues), yet all structurally unique protein families are represented. Periodically updated lists of representative data sets are available by electronic mail from the file server "netserv@embl-heidelberg.de." The selection may be useful in statistical approaches to protein folding as well as in the analysis and documentation of the known spectrum of three-dimensional protein structures.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: This study presents a novel investigation of the effect of kinetic control on cotranslational protein folding. We demonstrate the effect using simple HP lattice models and show that the cotranslational folding of proteins under kinetic control has a significant impact on the final conformation. Differences arise if nature is not capable of pushing a partially folded protein back over a large energy barrier. For this reason we argue that such constraints should be incorporated into structure prediction techniques. We introduce a finite surmountable energy barrier which allows partially formed chains to partly unfold, and permits us to enumerate exhaustively all energy pathways. RESULTS: We compare the ground states obtained sequentially with the global ground states of designing sequences (those with a unique global ground state).We find that the sequential ground states become less numerous and more compact as the surmountable energy barrier increases. We also introduce a probabilistic model to describe the distribution of final folds and allow partial settling to the Boltzmann distribution of states at each stage. As a result, conformations with the highest probability of final occurrence are not necessarily the ones of lowest energy.},

We advocate the application of principal component analysis (PCA) and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) method to reduce MD trajectories and overcome the drawbacks of clustering. To illustrate the superiority of nMDS over other methods in reducing data and reproducing salient features, we analyze three complete villin headpiece folding trajectories. Our analysis suggests that the folding process of the villin headpiece is structurally heterogeneous.},

While the atomic-level resolution provides unparalleled detail, it can be non-trivial to extract the important motions underlying simulations of complex systems containing many degrees of freedom. The diffusion map is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique with the capacity to systematically extract the essential dynamical modes of high-dimensional simulation trajectories, furnishing a kinetically meaningful low-dimensional framework with which to develop insight and understanding of the underlying dynamics and thermodynamics. We survey the potential of this approach in the field of molecular simulation, consider its challenges, and discuss its underlying concepts and means of application.
