dataset posted on 23.05.2018, 21:19 by Felix Enciso David Douches Marco Lopez-Cruz Joseph Coombs Gustavo de los Campos

Supplementary file S1 includes a pipeline in R to conduct SNP variance analysis, using different genetic models for autotetraploid potatoes. File S2 and S3 include genotypic and phenotypic information for late blight and common scab, respectively. File S4 includes supplementary tables cited in the paper. Finally, the supplementary figures S1 and S2 include linkage disequilibrium plots for the top ten SNP according to their contribution to the late blight and common scab variance, respectively.
