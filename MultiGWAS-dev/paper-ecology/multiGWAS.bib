abstract = {The genetic basis of quantitative disease resistance has been studied in crops for several decades as an alternative to R gene mediated resistance. The most important disease in the potato crop is late blight, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Quantitative disease resistance (QDR), as any other quantitative trait in plants, can be genetically mapped to understand the genetic architecture. Association mapping using DNA-based markers has been implemented in many crops to dissect quantitative traits. We used an association mapping approach with candidate genes to identify the first genes associated with quantitative resistance to late blight in Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja. Twentyï€­nine candidate genes were selected from a set of genes that were differentially expressed during the resistance response to late blight in tetraploid European potato cultivars. The 29 genes were amplified and sequenced in 104 accessions of S. tuberosum Group Phureja from Latin America. We identified 238 SNPs in the selected genes and tested them for association with resistance to late blight. The phenotypic data were obtained under field conditions by determining the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) in two seasons and in two locations. Two genes were associated with QDR to late blight, a potato homologue of thylakoid lumen 15 kDa protein (StTL15A) and a stem 28 kDa glycoprotein (StGP28).},

abstract = {The potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the fourth most important crop food in the world and Colombia has one of the most important collections of potato germplasm in the world (the Colombian Central Collection-CCC). Little is known about its potential as a source of genetic diversity for molecular breeding programs. In this study, we analyzed 809 Andigenum group accessions from the CCC using 5968 SNPs to determine: 1) the genetic diversity and population structure of the Andigenum germplasm and 2) the usefulness of this collection to map qualitative traits across the potato genome. The genetic structure analysis based on principal components, cluster analyses, and Bayesian inference revealed that the CCC can be subdivided into two main groups associated with their ploidy level: Phureja (diploid) and Andigena (tetraploid). The Andigena population was more genetically diverse but less genetically substructured than the Phureja population (three vs. five subpopulations, respectively). The association mapping analysis of qualitative morphological data using 4666 SNPs showed 23 markers significantly associated with nine morphological traits. The present study showed that the CCC is a highly diverse germplasm collection genetically and phenotypically, useful to implement association mapping in order to identify genes related to traits of interest and to assist future potato genetic breeding programs.},

However, despite its successes, GWAS have not been able to identify genetic loci that are effective classifiers of disease, limiting their value for genetic testing. This chapter highlights the challenges that lie ahead for GWAS in better identifying disease risk predictors, and how we may address them. In this regard, we review basic concepts regarding GWAS, the technologies used for capturing genetic variation, the missing heritability problem, the need for efficient study design especially for replication efforts, reducing the bias introduced into a dataset, and how to utilize new resources available, such as electronic medical records. We also look to what lies ahead for the field, and the approaches that can be taken to realize the full potential of GWAS.},

abstract = {Abstract Despite the importance of polyploidy and the increasing availability of new genomic data, there remain important gaps in our knowledge of polyploid population genetics. These gaps arise from the complex nature of polyploid data (e.g. multiple alleles and loci, mixed inheritance patterns, association between ploidy and mating system variation). Furthermore, many of the standard tools for population genetics that have been developed for diploids are often not feasible for polyploids. This review aims to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in polyploid population genetics and to identify the main areas where further development of molecular techniques and statistical theory is required. We review commonly used molecular tools (amplified fragment length polymorphism, microsatellites, Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing and derived technologies) and their challenges associated with their use in polyploid populations: that is, allele dosage determination, null alleles, difficulty of distinguishing orthologues from paralogues and copy number variation. In addition, we review the approaches that have been used for population genetic analysis in polyploids and their specific problems. These problems are in most cases directly associated with dosage uncertainty and the problem of inferring allele frequencies and assumptions regarding inheritance. This leads us to conclude that for advancing the field of polyploid population genetics, most priority should be given to development of new molecular approaches that allow efficient dosage determination, and to further development of analytical approaches to circumvent dosage uncertainty and to accommodate {\^{a}}â‚¬Ëœflexible{\^{a}}â‚¬â„¢ modes of inheritance. In addition, there is a need for more simulation-based studies that test what kinds of biases could result from both existing and novel approaches.},

abstract = {The additive relationship matrix plays an important role in mixed model prediction of breeding values. For genotype matrix X (loci in columns), the product XX9 is widely used as a realized relationship matrix, but the scaling of this matrix is ambiguous. Our first objective was to derive a proper scaling such that the mean diagonal element equals 1+f, where f is the inbreeding coefficient of the current population. The result is a formula involving the covariance matrix for sampling genomic loci, which must be estimated with markers. Our second objective was to investigate whether shrinkage estimation of this covariance matrix can improve the accuracy of breeding value (GEBV) predictions with low-density markers. Using an analytical formula for shrinkage intensity that is optimal with respect to mean-squared error, simulations revealed that shrinkage can significantly increase GEBV accuracy in unstructured populations, but only for phenotyped lines; there was no benefit for unphenotyped lines. The accuracy gain from shrinkage increased with heritability, but at high heritability (. 0.6) this benefit was irrelevant because phenotypic accuracy was comparable. These trends were confirmed in a commercial pig population with progeny-test-estimated breeding values. For an anonymous trait where phenotypic accuracy was 0.58, shrinkage increased the average GEBV accuracy from 0.56 to 0.62 (SE , 0.00) when using random sets of 384 markers from a 60K array. We conclude that when moderate-accuracy phenotypes and low-density markers are available for the candidates of genomic selection, shrinkage estimation of the relationship matrix can improve genetic gain. {\textcopyright} 2012 Endelman, Jannink.},

abstract = {Abstract Polyploidization is an ancient and recurrent process in plant evolution, impacting the diversification of natural populations and plant breeding strategies. Polyploidization occurs in many important crops; however, its effects on inheritance of many agronomic traits are still poorly understood compared with diploid species. Higher levels of allelic dosage or more complex interactions between alleles could affect the phenotype expression. Hence, the present study aimed to dissect the genetic basis of fruit-related traits in autotetraploid blueberries and identify candidate genes affecting phenotypic variation. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) assuming diploid and tetraploid inheritance, encompassing distinct models of gene action (additive, general, different orders of allelic interaction and the corresponding diploidized models). A total of 1,575 southern highbush blueberry individuals from a breeding population of 117 full-sib families were genotyped using sequence capture and next-generation sequencing, and evaluated for eight fruit-related traits. For the diploid allele calling, 77,496 SNPs were detected; while 80,591 SNPs were obtained in tetraploid, with a high degree of overlap (95%) between them. A linear mixed model that accounted for population and family structure was used for the GWAS analyses. By modeling tetraploid genotypes, we detected 15 SNPs significantly associated with five fruit-related traits. Alternatively, seven significant SNPs were detected for only two traits using diploid genotypes, with two SNPs overlapping with the tetraploid scenario. Our results showed that the importance of tetraploid models varied by trait and that the use of diploid models has hindered the detection of SNP-trait associations and, consequently, the genetic architecture of some commercially important traits in autotetraploid species. Furthermore, 14 SNPs co-localized with candidate genes, five of which lead to non-synonymous amino acid changes. The potential functional significance of these SNPs is discussed.},

abstract = {Cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), a vegetatively propagated autotetraploid, has been bred for distinct market classes, including fresh market, pigmented, and processing varieties. Breeding efforts have relied on phenotypic selection of populations developed from intra-and intermarket class crosses and introgressions of wild and cultivated Solanum relatives. To retrospectively explore the effects of potato breeding at the genome level, we used 8303 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers to genotype a 250- line diversity panel composed of wild species, genetic stocks, and cultivated potato lines with release dates ranging from 1857 to 2011. Population structure analysis revealed four subpopulations within the panel, with cultivatedpotato lines grouping together and separate from wild species and genetic stocks. With pairwise kinship estimates clear separation between potato market classes was observed. Modern breeding efforts have scarcely changed the percentage of heterozygous loci or the frequency of homozygous, single-dose, and duplex loci on a genome level, despite concerted efforts by breeders. In contrast, clear selection in less than 50 years of breeding was observed for alleles in biosynthetic pathways important for market class-specific traits such as pigmentation and carbohydrate composition. Although improvement and diversification for distinct market classes was observed through whole-genome analysis of historic and current potato lines, an increased rate of gain from selection will be required to meet growing global food demands and challenges due to climate change. Understanding the genetic basis of diversification and trait improvement will allow for more rapid genome-guided improvement of potato in future breeding efforts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Hirsch et al.},

abstract = {Potato genotypes from a breeding population adapted to tropical highlands were analyzed for the stability of late blight resistance and also for marker-phenotype association. We harmonized the historical evaluation data, consisting of observations spanning 6 years from two field sites utilizing a resistance scale constructed by comparing the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) values of 172 genotypes with that of susceptible control 'Yungay'. In total, 70 potato genotypes had a coefficient of variability <0.5 and were considered stable across the environments tested. A principal component analysis demonstrated that the ensemble of experiments formed two distinct groups that reflect the stability of genotype resistance to late blight. Phytophthora infestans isolates present in the experimental fields belonged to the EC-1 clonal lineage and showed variation in virulence beyond the concept of the avirulence determined by the conventionally used R1-R11 differential set. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker on chromosome 9 was associated with late blight resistance and linked to instability. Genotypes with either AACC or AAAC combinations for this SNP were highly resistant only in some environments, while the genotypes with the AAAA combination had more moderate levels of resistance but were stable across environments. {\textcopyright} 2014 The American Phytopathological Society.},

abstract = {Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely used to map loci contributing to variation in complex traits and risk of diseases in humans. Accurate specification of familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized) family structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating allele frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This assumption is often untenable. Results: Here, we present a rapid algorithm for relationship inference using high-throughput genotype data typical of GWAS that allows the presence of unknown population substructure. The relationship of any pair of individuals can be precisely inferred by robust estimation of their kinship coefficient, independent of sample composition or population structure (sample invariance). We present simulation experiments to demonstrate that the algorithm has sufficient power to provide reliable inference on millions of unrelated pairs and thousands of relative pairs (up to 3rd-degree relationships). Application of our robust algorithm to HapMap and GWAS datasets demonstrates that it performs properly even under extreme population stratification, while algorithms assuming a homogeneous population give systematically biased results. Our extremely efficient implementation performs relationship inference on millions of pairs of individuals in a matter of minutes, dozens of times faster than the most efficient existing algorithm known to us. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

abstract = {Background: Oyster is rich in glycogen and free amino acids and is called "the milk of sea". To understand the main genetic effects of these traits and the genetic networks underlying their correlation, we have conducted the whole genome resequencing with 427 oysters collected from the world-wide scale. Results: After association analysis, 168 clustered significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were identified for glycogen content and 17 SNPs were verified with 288 oyster individuals in another wide populations. These were the most important candidate loci for oyster breeding. Among 24 genes in the 100-kb regions of the leading SNP loci, cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) contained a non-synonymous SNP and displayed higher expressions in high glycogen content individuals. This might enhance the gluconeogenesis process by the transcriptionally regulating the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Also, for amino acids content, 417 clustered significant SNPs were identified. After genetic network analysis, three node SNP regions were identified to be associated with glycogen, protein, and Asp content, which might explain their significant correlation. Conclusion: Overall, this study provides insights into the genetic correlation among complex traits, which will facilitate future oyster functional studies and breeding through molecular design.},

Materials and Methods: To validate whether the same variations conferred risk to CRC in the Han Chinese population, we genotyped 760 individuals (380 controls and 380 cases samples) recruited from the Han Chinese origin. Results: We found rs11987193 in 8p12 (P = 0.0472 after correction, OR = 0.751) was significantly associated with CRC but rs12080929 in 1p33 (P = 0.0650 after correction, OR = 0.750) was not.

abstract = {Petal color is one of the key characteristics determining the attractiveness and therefore the commercial value of an ornamental crop. Here, we present the first genome-wide association study for the important ornamental crop rose, focusing on the anthocyanin and carotenoid contents in petals of 96 diverse tetraploid garden rose genotypes. Cultivated roses display a vast phenotypic and genetic diversity and are therefore ideal targets for association genetics. For marker analysis, we used a recently designed Axiom SNP chip comprising 68,000 SNPs with additionally 281 SSRs, 400 AFLPs and 246 markers from candidate genes. An analysis of the structure of the rose population revealed three subpopulations with most of the genetic variation between individual genotypes rather than between clusters and with a high average proportion of heterozygous loci. The mapping of markers significantly associated with anthocyanin and carotenoid content to the related Fragaria and Prunus genomes revealed clusters of associated markers indicating five genomic regions associated with the total anthocyanin content and two large clusters associated with the carotenoid content. Among the marker clusters associated with the phenotypes, we found several candidate genes with known functions in either the anthocyanin or the carotenoid biosynthesis pathways. Among others, we identified a glutathione-S-transferase, 4CL, an auxin response factor and F3'H as candidate genes affecting anthocyanin concentration, and CCD4 and Zeaxanthine epoxidase as candidates affecting the concentration of carotenoids. These markers are starting points for future validation experiments in independent populations as well as for functional genomic studies to identify the causal factors for the observed color phenotypes. Furthermore, validated markers may be interesting tools for marker-assisted selection in commercial breeding programmes in that they provide the tools to identify superior parental combinations that combine several associated markers in higher dosages.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018 Reid et al. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a powerful tool for analyzing complex traits in crop plants. The current study evaluates the efficacy of various GWAS models and methods for elucidating population structure in potato. The presence of significant population structure can lead to detection of spurious marker-trait associations, as well as mask true ones. While appropriate statistical models are needed to detect true marker-trait associations, in most published potato GWAS, a 'one model fits all traits' approach has been adopted. We have examined various GWAS models on a large association panel comprising diverse tetraploid potato cultivars and breeding lines, genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Phenotypic data were generated for 20 quantitative traits assessed in different environments. Best Linear Unbiased Estimates (BLUEs) for these traits were obtained for use in assessing GWAS models. Goodness of fit of GWAS models, derived using different combinations of kinship and population structure for all traits, was evaluated using Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots and genomic control inflation factors (lGC). Kinship was found to play a major role in correcting population confounding effects and results advocate a 'trait-specific' fit of different GWAS models. A survey of genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD), one of the critical factors affecting GWAS, is also presented and our findings are compared to other recent studies in potato. The genetic material used here, and the outputs of this study represent a novel resource for genetic analysis in potato.},

One key factor influencing the statistical reliability of GWAS is the amount of input data used. In this paper, we investigate how input data quantity influences output of four widely used GWAS programs, PLINK, TASSEL, GAPIT, and FaST-LMM, in the context of plant genomes and phenotypes. Both synthetic and real data are used. Evaluation is based on p- and q-values of output SNPs, and Kendall rank correlation between output SNP lists. Results show that for the same GWAS program, different Arabidopsis thaliana datasets demonstrate similar trends of rank correlation with varied input quantity, but differentiate on the numbers of SNPs passing a given p- or q-value threshold. We also show that variations in numbers of replicates influence the p-values of SNPs, but do not strongly affect the rank correlation.},

abstract = {By conducting a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) using GWASpoly R package, three resistance QTLs were identified on potato chromosomes 2, 4, and 12, respectively. The phenotypic variation explained by these QTLs was 21%, 19%, and 26%, respectively. The QTL on chromosome 2 was simplex-dominant whereas duplex-dominant QTLs were identified on chromosomes 4 and 12. These findings will be useful to design marker-assisted selection and breeding strategies to improve resistance to common scab in new potato cultivars.},

abstract = {Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a major tuberous crop produced worldwide. In this study, we sequenced 158 diverse cassava varieties and identified 349,827 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels. In each chromosome, the number of SNPs and the physical length of the respective chromosome were in agreement. Population structure analysis indicated that this panel can be divided into three subgroups. Genetic diversity analysis indicated that the average nucleotide diversity of the panel was 1.21 Ã— 10âˆ’4 for all sampled landraces. This average nucleotide diversity was 1.97 Ã— 10âˆ’4, 1.01 Ã— 10âˆ’4, and 1.89 Ã— 10âˆ’4 for subgroups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis demonstrated that the average LD was about âˆ¼8 kb. We evaluated 158 cassava varieties under 11 different environments. Finally, we identified 36 loci that were related to 11 agronomic traits by genome-wide association analyses. Four loci were associated with two traits, and 62 candidate genes were identified in the peak SNP sites. We found that 40 of these genes showed different expression profiles in different tissues. Of the candidate genes related to storage roots, Manes.13G023300, Manes.16G000800, Manes.02G154700, Manes.02G192500, and Manes.09G099100 had higher expression levels in storage roots than in leaf and stem; on the other hand, of the candidate genes related to leaves, Manes.05G164500, Manes.05G164600, Manes.04G057300, Manes.01G202000, and Manes.03G186500 had higher expression levels in leaves than in storage roots and stem. This study provides basis for research on genetics and the genetic improvement of cassava.},
