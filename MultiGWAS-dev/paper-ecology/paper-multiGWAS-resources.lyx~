Good QC should filter out artifacts, and yield a ‘manhattan plot’ like the
 one below.
 Each point is a SNP laid out across the human chromosomes from left to
 right, and the heights correspond to the strength of the association to
 disease.
 You’ll see that the strongest associations (highlighted in green) form
 neat peaks where nearby correlated SNPs all show the same signal.
 Any manhattan plot with points all over the place should be viewed as highly
 suspicious (as raised by Daniel in this excellent post).

As the very nature of GWAS involves hundreds of thousands of accession-phenotype
 association tests, multiple testing correction needs to be addressed.
 To this end, the Benjamini-Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)
 is employed to correct the pro- vided P values.
 Another approach is to visually ob- serve how the most significant P values
 deviate from the expected distribution.
 Ideally, a higher than ex- pected fraction of marker-associated P values
 will be skewed toward significant values.

Determining the correct P-value threshold for statis- tical significance
 is critical to differentiate true positives from false positives and false
 negatives.
 To determine the statistical significance threshold in GWAS, different
 statistical procedures accounting for multiple testing have been proposed,
 including the Bonferroni correction, Sidak correction, False Discovery
 Rate (FDR), permutation test, and Bayesian approaches.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Bonferroni correction and FDR [11–15] are the two most commonly used methods
 for crops limit type 1 errors (false-positives), but they almost certainly
 inflate type 2 errors (false negatives) [16].
 The Bonferroni correction method is considered the most conservative method
 for selecting a threshold P- value due to the assumption that every genetic
 variant tested is independent of the rest.
 The False Discovery Rate controls the expected proportion of false positives
 among the rejected null hypotheses and is a popular, less conservative
 approach compared to the Bonferroni cor- rection [15].

Deviations for a high number of markers, especially in the range of intermediate
 to high p-values, indicate the presence of confounders that artificially
 inflate the p-values (e.g., Fig.
 3a).
 This inflation can be caused, for example, by population structure or cryptic
 relatedness among the individuals.
 As mentioned in Subheadings 1.3.1 and 3.4—for population structure—a correction
 needs to be performed in order to avoid reporting false positive results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A common way to assess the degree of population structure in the data is
 to compute the genomic inflation factor λGC [55].
 It describes the deviation of the median of the observed test statistics
 from the median of the expected test statistics.
 Since the distribution of the test statistics under the null hypothesis
 is known (either because there is a closed form representation, or because
 it has been derived empirically using permutation testing), so is its median.
 Considering the assumption that most of the SNPs are not associated with
 the trait, λGC should be close to one if no confounder is present [56].
 If λGC is inflated (larger than 1) or deflated (lower than 1), a correction
 for population structure is recommended to avoid false positives or false
 negatives, respectively.
 The inflation or deflation of p-values can be easily visualized in a Q-Q
 plot (refer

 The inflation of p-values above the y = x line in such a plot is an indicator
 of the failure of the model to control for population structure.
 Inflation was quantified by the linear regression coefficient of the observed

 null hypothesis (Riedelsheimer et al., 2012).

Three different methods are available in GWASpoly for establishing a p-value
 detection threshold for statisti- cal significance.
 The first is the Bonferroni correction, which uses a threshold of a/m to
 ensure the genome- wide type I error with m markers is no greater than
 a.
 The second approach is the random permutation test, in which phenotypes
 are randomly permuted to explicitly construct the genome-wide null distribution
 of p-values (Churchill and Doerge, 1994).
 The third option uses the qvalue package (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003)
 to control the genome-wide false discovery rate (rather than Type I error
 = probability of false positive).

Genome-wide significance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One issue that causes much concern in the meta-analysis of GWAS is the definitio
n of the level of evidence required to be confident that an effect is not
 due to chance.
 Like primary GWAS, meta-analyses usually define P-value thresholds at which
 they will declare a finding to be genome-wide significant, often values
 around the 5?10?7 or 10?8 are used [55–57], perhaps combined with a less
 stringent level of 10?5 or 10?6 at which variants will be considered interestin
g enough to warrant further investigation.
 Given the huge number of variants that are available for study, such low
 P-value thresholds are required to guard against the production of large
 numbers of false positives; however, they have the drawback that such conservat
ism may cause many variants with small real effects to be overlooked.
 The concept of genome-wide significance comes from viewing a GWAS, or the
 meta-analysis of GWAS, as a giant test of thousands or millions of independent
 hypotheses.
 However, due to the cor- relation between variants it is very difficult
 to specify separate hypotheses meaningfully and because of the many different
 ways in which a variant can act on a trait it is almost impossible to say
 in advance what statistical assumptions can be made when specifying the
 meta-analysis.

The GWA approach is revolutionary because it permits interrogation of the
 entire human genome at levels of resolution previously unattainable, in
 thousands of unrelated individuals, unconstrained by prior hypotheses regarding
 genetic associations with dis- ease.
 However, the GWA approach can also be problematic because the massive number
 of statistical tests performed presents an unprecedented potential for
 false-positive results, leading to new stringency in acceptable levels
 of statistical significance and requirements for replication of findings.

In a traditional (univariate) genome-wide association study, a measure of
 association or statistical dependence between each individual SNP and the
 phenotype is computed.
 Then a p-value is derived for each association score, which represents
 the probability of observing an association signal of the same strength
 or stronger under the null hypothesis of no association between the SNP
 and the phenotype.
 If the p-value falls below a predefined significance threshold α, commonly
 0.01 or 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected, which means that there is
 an association between the SNP and the phenotype.
 Despite the strong evidence against the null hypothesis in this case, there
 remains a chance of α∗ 100% that the low p-value is purely due to random
 chance and that the detected association is therefore a false positive
 result.
 Avoiding false positive findings is among the major challenges in GWAS.

However, there has been some criticism of this threshold, with a 2012 study
 suggesting that a significant number of associations with p-values just
 above this threshold are genuine, replicable associations.
 The authors of this study concluded that their finding "...suggests a possible
 relaxation in the current GWS threshold."[3] More recently, it has been
 suggested that the conventional threshold should be modified to take into
 account the increasing prevalence of low-frequency genetic variants in
 genome-wide association studies.[4] References

Don't adjust the p values.
 Instead, adjust the threshold below which a p value is considered significant.
 This is the standard practice in genomics.
 The formulat is simple: Multiply the number of genetic markers by the number
 of phenotypes.
 This gives you the number of hypotheses tested.
 Then, divide 0.05 by that number.
 You now have the threshold below which a pa value is considered significant.
 It is much more transparent than adjusting the p itself.
 It may be a bit too conservative if the SNPs are in substantial LD (a problem
 that adjusting the p-value itself doesn't abolish).
 If it is a genome-wide study, where you reasonably expect a very large
 number of true positives (e.g.
 hundreds, such as in genome-wide eQTL searches) the false discovery rate
 (q value) makes much more sense and is much more powerful.
 Q-VALUE is an implementation of the required calculations (http://genomics.princ
eton.edu/storeylab/qvalue/) but I prefer to do mine on an Excel sheet, so
 I can plot the data my way.

A mixed linear model (MLM) includes both fixed and random effects.
 Including individuals as random effects gives an MLM the ability to incorporate
 information about relationships among individuals.
 This information about relationships is conveyed through the kinship (K)
 matrix, which is used in an MLM as the variance-covariance matrix between
 the individuals.
 When a genetic marker-based kinship matrix (K) is used jointly with population
 structure (commonly called the “Q” matrix, and can be obtained through
 STRUCTURE11 or conducting a principal component analysis12), the “Q+K”
 approach improves statistical power compared to “Q” only9.
 An MLM can be described using Henderson’s matrix notation6 as follows:
 Y = Xβ + Zu + e, (1) where Y is the vector of observed phenotypes; β is
 an unknown vector containing fixed effects, including the genetic marker,
 population structure (Q), and the intercept; u is an unknown vector of
 random additive genetic effects from multiple background QTL for individuals/li
nes; X and Z are the known design matrices; and e is the unobserved vector
 of residuals.

In terms of the effects of input data quantity on GWAS results, it is both
 program and measurement specific.
 One can expect a linearly increasing relationship between input quantity
 and numbers of SNPs passing a threshold for PLINK, but no guarantee for
 TASSEL, FaST-LMM, and GAPIT.
 Viewed alternatively, it appears that the latter three programs are less
 robust to a reduction in the amount of input.
 The experimental results also suggest that setting a threshold p- or q-value
 for significant SNPs should be program specific.

 In this case the research team benefits from an already collected raw dataset

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The ever-growing availability of high-quality genotypes for a multitude
 of species has enabled researchers to explore the underlying genetic architectu
re of complex phenotypes at an unprecedented level of detail using genome-wide
 association studies (GWAS).
 The systematic comparison of results obtained from GWAS of different traits
 opens up new possibilities, including the analysis of pleiotropic effects.
 Other advantages that result from the integration of multiple GWAS are
 the ability to replicate GWAS signals and to increase statistical power
 to detect such signals through meta-analyses.
 In order to facilitate the simple comparison of GWAS results, we present
 easyGWAS, a powerful, species-independent online resource for computing,
 storing, sharing, annotating, and comparing GWAS.
 The easyGWAS tool supports multiple species, the uploading of private genotype
 data and summary statistics of existing GWAS, as well as advanced methods
 for comparing GWAS results across different experiments and data sets in
 an interactive and user-friendly interface.
 easyGWAS is also a public data repository for GWAS data and summary statistics
 and already includes published data and results from several major GWAS.
 We demonstrate the potential of easyGWAS with a case study of the model
 organism Arabidopsis thaliana, using flowering and growth-related traits.

The first is the Manhattan plot, which plots the P value of each variant
 against its position (see the figure).
 The x-axis represents the genomic location.
 The y-axis is the –log(P value).
 The logarithmic scale is used so that the most significant single-nucleotide
 polymorphisms (SNPs) stand out with higher values than the majority of
 non-significant SNPs.
 A reference line is used on the y-axis to reflect genome-wide significance,
 occasionally with a second line to represent a ‘suggestive significance’
 threshold.
 Owing to the expectation of linkage disequilibrium (LD), a single highly
 significant SNP on its own is often interpreted as a genotyping error.
 Columns of significant SNPs in LD with the truly causal variant are seen
 in human studies, although this expectation is dependent on the LD of the
 organism.

 Its genetic location is indicated on the x-axis, and the –log10 of its
 p-value on the y-axis (see plots in second column of Fig.
 3a–d).
 This transformation results in SNPs with low p- values (and therefore stronger
 association) to have high values on the y-axis.
 Due to LD, SNPs in close proximity to each other show similar association
 to the phenotype, resulting in spikes in close proximity to SNPs with low
 p-values.

Departure of observed SNP P values from the y = x reference line may reflect

 owing to a lack of power.

gives a measure of the inflation in the sample.
 This should be 1 in the case of the null and is generally seen as inflation
 if above 1.05.
 The lambda value can be weighted by sample size to avoid polygenic inflation,
 as larger samples have the power to detect inflation owing to many SNPs
 of small effect.
 In this case, λ1000 is used to get an inflation estimate proportional to
 a GWAS that contained only 1,000 samples.

 Possible reasons for this are (a) little evidence in the data to support
